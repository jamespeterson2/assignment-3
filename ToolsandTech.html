        In terms of the required software, hardware and tools needed to deliver this project, inspiration is taken from how price comparison websites are built and run. When establishing the data sources for the scholarship information, requesting access to APIs (Application Programming Interface) and data feeds directly from organisations such as RMIT would be unlikely due to issues of privacy and security. Therefore, a web scraping software could be implemented as it is useful in extracting data quickly and efficiently from multiple web page sources (Patel 2019), this software would then extract the necessary data defined by the criteria as long as the information is still available on the website. The software basically simulates a human browsing a website, it acts as a bot that automatically completes the data gathering process. With the targeted web page URL or list of URLs inputted, the server receives a request and responds with the HTML source code, with this the bot is able to retrieve the target data located on a node, the bot can then access and parse the data as instructed by the scraping code (Octoparse 2022). Depending on the configuration, the group of data will be organised into a structure and made available for download or transfer to our database.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whilst conducting web research it is apparent that there are many different web scraping software/tools to choose from. Moreover, there are several key factors to consider when making the choice, this includes:
          <ul>
  <li>Making sure the tool is compatible with our system as some only support Mac, Linux, or Windows</li>
  <li>Pricing, at this 	stage we are primarily looking for tools with a free option/tier</li>
  <li>Cloud service integration is a key aspect as we want to access the data across multiple devices at any given time</li>
  <li>Difficulty in terms of learning how to use the tool and programming to work</li>
  <li>Referring to RMIT’S privacy and security, we must make sure the tool is able to access RMIT’s websites without being blocked</li>
</ul>
        </p>

        <div class="text_why">

        <p>
One of the tool options we have found is ScraperAPI, it is a web scraping tool that is able to handle proxies, CAPTCHAs and anti-bot protection, it has cloud service integration, offers free use for 5000 API calls, and boasts easy integration and customisation for developers (ScraperAPI 2022; Wise 2022). Another option that seemed to be popular online was Scrapy, it is an open-source framework for web scraping that is programmed in Python. Majority of the group is not too familiar with Python, thereby this needs to be learned in order to use this tool effectively, additionally this could be a valuable skill to learn that would assist us further during the design phase of the website’s function and ultimately for any future work and studies in IT.
        </p>

<p>
  Once there is a third-party integration with RMIT's website and our service, there would be a need for APIs to enhance the capabilities of the website for the user, such as a detailed search function. Moreover, a cloud computing service such as AWS (Amazon Web Service) offers a free tier and would be valuable in terms of being scalable, secure, reliable and flexible when storing data, and deploying websites and apps. A dedicated role in developing the user interface (UI), as well as front-end and back-end would allow us to create and develop our service in a way for users to access easily and effectively.
</p>

<p>
  A deliverable of this project would be the functioning website and the measure of success could be if a test user was able to use the UI with ease and able to gain value and insight into the scholarships available to them. Ease of use and accessibility can be provided via a search function that is capable of using a number of pre-defined filters and category selections, additionally the website should be able to display scholarships available to them through a list which directs and forwards them to the scholarship’s webpage for more information, all in quick succession. This will overall demonstrate the success of the web scraping tool and functionality of the website which will assist students take advantage of scholarships made available to them.
