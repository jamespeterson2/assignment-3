        For this project to be completed, we will need to request access to APIs (Application Programming Interface) from universities such as RMIT as an example, in order to access scholarship data however this may be unlikely due to privacy and security reasons. Because of this, we would need to utilize a web scraping program such as ScraperAPI which has 5000 API calls. This is a great tool for us as it is compatible with Mac and Windows which is required as our group members have both operating systems on their machines.

For the python script the code editor utilized is sublime text, this is used as it is a preference of many in the group with multi line editing being a powerful feature. Also, for python to work, the most up to date python needs to be installed as it has access to many importable libraries such as BeautifulSoup which is used to web scrape. For this we can use Anaconda Prompt and then in that prompt libraries can then be installed. The script will also be run through PowerShell on Windows machines.

As our python skills are limited because the course is an introduction to IT and many of the group members have little experience with python coding, for websites that are formatted in a way that makes it difficult to scrape data from them using python due to drop down menus that have varying tag names in the HTML and CSS a web scraper tool known simply as Web Scraper can be used as a Chrome extension to allow us to get as many scholarships as possible.

We will need to also use GitHub to host a collaborative website programming system for our group to write HTML and CSS code within Atom and upload it to a repository for members to see. This will be needed as we need to create a UI for the project to display itâ€™s found scholarships. Because of previous assessment tasks taken by everyone within the group, everyone in the team has experience using both Atom and GitHub making the use of these software's easier to implement, because of this we also know it is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.

To display the generated CSV file from the Web Scrapper on a webpage for users to see JavaScript will have to be utilized. To display the information in a neat table on a page first the CSV file will have to be converted to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), to do this we took an already generated JavaScript file called Papa Parse which completes this function for us.

Another piece of collaborative software we will need is Microsoft Teams and OneDrive to store our gathered Scraper information and any parts for the report for the whole assignment's requirements, this also is a piece of software that has been used by everyone within the team making it easy to utilize within out project.

As we are creating a single website, we could have multiple testing periods where one component is added to a website and then is tested by the developer to use and analyse for any bugs or issues that may arise. Once tested, we will be able to move on and add the next component where we will be able to repeat the testing. After every part of the website has been added and tested, we will select a small number of students seeking scholarships to use our website and inform us on what went well and wrong. Once, feedback is received we will be able to amend the errors and publish the website publicly.
