          This group has been one of the best groups I have worked with during my university career, and it has shown me that with effective communication involving weekly meetings the delegation of work and the understanding of what needs to be done becomes much clearer making the entire process of completing the work much easier. For this last assignment, the only real issue was one out of control of the group members and that was the interference with people schedules due to having many other commitments to other courses assignments as it is the final weeks of university for the semester leading to many assignments all being due around similar times, leading to less communication within our messages as a result.

        Canâ€™t speak highly enough about how our group performed, everyone attended meetings or gave reasonable notice if they could not which is shown by the attendance reports for each meeting, we held over the course of the semester on Microsoft teams. In the meetings, we were able to assign tasks to individuals which were based on strengths or areas on which people had worked on before and everyone was able to show tangible progress at every meeting. We noticed that communication in-between meetings as the end of the semester approached and other assessments began to come in, however, we noticed this did not affect progress much as we were able to assign tasks in meetings which will help in the completion of the project thus team members did not have to communicate outside of the meetings to get the work done. This really showed the importance of good planning and man management in group projects especially when team members have other priorities too, by setting clear goals and tasks for team members to complete the progress we made was not hindered and we were able to operate effectively as individuals and as a group. The only real improvement I could point out is for the group as a whole is not to have a fear to speak out when they need help or are overburdened with the workload, they have been assigned at the end of the day the group members are there to help the team to achieve our end goal.
