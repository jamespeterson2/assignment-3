          This group has been one of the best groups I have worked with during my university career, and it has shown me that with effective communication involving weekly meetings the delegation of work and the understanding of what needs to be done becomes much clearer making the entire process of completing the work much easier. For this last assignment, the only real issue was one out of control of the group members and that was the interference with people schedules due to having many other commitments to other courses assignments as it is the final weeks of university for the semester leading to many assignments all being due around similar times, leading to less communication within our messages as a result.

In my experience with university group assignments over the last few years I can undoubtedly say that this group’s ability, skill assets, and overall dynamics to communicate and make progress in our objectives has been by far one of the most enjoyable and well-functioning groups I have participated in. We were all able to delegate and effectively communicate plans, tasks and roles with the support of active communication and regular team meetings, everybody showed up and was cooperative throughout each project. However, as the group reached the end of the semester and with other subject assignment deadlines approaching there was a drop off in active communication, that is really the only thing I could nit-pick to improve on. We were seeing less progress updates on everyone’s sections, however with each weekly meeting all group members were able to demonstrate their completion of their part assigned for that week, I believe that if we kept up the active chats we wouldn’t have to stress as much towards the deadline for this project. A surprising thing I noticed from each group member was their own strength and skills really shined through and was well suited for particular parts of the project. Tommy and I as business majors, were good at writing, researching, and explaining content, whereas Gurpreet, Austin and Jason T were well suited for the technical aspects and back-end work of the project with their skills in IT. I believe everyone excelled and contributed to the project in their roles positively, moreover, I have learnt that communication, team synergy and a mix of skills really can lead to a positive experience and outcome in a group assignment such as ours.

        Can’t speak highly enough about how our group performed, everyone attended meetings or gave reasonable notice if they could not which is shown by the attendance reports for each meeting, we held over the course of the semester on Microsoft teams. In the meetings, we were able to assign tasks to individuals which were based on strengths or areas on which people had worked on before and everyone was able to show tangible progress at every meeting. We noticed that communication in-between meetings as the end of the semester approached and other assessments began to come in, however, we noticed this did not affect progress much as we were able to assign tasks in meetings which will help in the completion of the project thus team members did not have to communicate outside of the meetings to get the work done. This really showed the importance of good planning and man management in group projects especially when team members have other priorities too, by setting clear goals and tasks for team members to complete the progress we made was not hindered and we were able to operate effectively as individuals and as a group. The only real improvement I could point out is for the group as a whole is not to have a fear to speak out when they need help or are overburdened with the workload, they have been assigned at the end of the day the group members are there to help the team to achieve our end goal.

Our group worked really well together throughout assignment 2 and carried over that good performance into assignment 3. Every week we had a group call and each time every group member was in attendance and on time. Everyone was allocated work fairly and evenly and all completed the work by the time that they said they would. Overall, I can’t complain at all with this group and it’s easily the best group I’ve worked in while at university. Our weekly meetings were definitely crucial when it came to our group's performance. We were always very clear with the expectations and deadlines which really helped. We did have a few group members that had big assignments to complete in other subjects and everyone was very understanding of that. We would get work done earlier or other group members would out to accommodate for other people’s busy schedule. Some group members knew more about certain sections than others, so they were always happy to either complete that section themselves or lend a hand to the person that was working on it. Planning and cooperation were really our groups strong point and was definitely the key to our success.
