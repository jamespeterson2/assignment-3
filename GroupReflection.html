        Throughout our group discussion and the process of the assignment, we found that we were all able to work well together in a team. Everyone in our team contributed an equal amount of work towards the assignment by assigning tasks to meet everyone's key strengths and if anyone was stuck, there would be others in the team to help each other out. We all came to our meetings on time with full attendance e which allowed us to not waste any time in terms of preparation for the assignment but to get more work done. Group discussions were useful for us as they allowed us to find something else to work on if we were finished with our assigned tasks. Overall, the group worked extremely well together and was able to put together a well-constructed web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        During our group’s reflection we discussed key areas that we feel needed to be improved for this assignment and going forward into assignment 3. We all felt that nothing outstandingly bad was occurring in terms of our group’s performance and assignment, however, we collectively agreed that on occasion during our group discussions there needed to be more initiative from group members in starting conversation based on their work. We believe that everyone needs to attain some level of leadership skills and confidence within their life and not be too afraid to speak up or lead conversations within groups. Furthermore, we realised that recordings during our group meetings were not being recorded, leading us to missing recordings and transcripts for many of our discussions. To fix this issue for the upcoming assignment we are making sure to enable automatic recordings by accessing the “meeting options” within teams, and visually verifying that the recording is active.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main thing that really surprised all of us is how good all our potential job prospects are going to be in the future with everyone one of our ideal jobs having at least stable growth over the next five years. The biggest surprises were the increase in the projected employment rate for the cyber security analyst and the software developer roles with a 38.9% and 27% increase over the next five years respectively. Another surprise to our group was just how well we all worked together. Everyone attended every meeting we had, completed all the work they said they would by the time it was expected to be finished. This is likely because we scheduled our meetings a week before they happened to give everybody plenty of time. We also kept each other accountable for completing our sections and helped each other out if it was required.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest thing that we learnt is that to be truly successful as a group we need to identify the biggest strengths of each group member and create an environment where everyone can work to their biggest strengths which allows for any weaknesses to be less exaggerated. In our group, we assigned the IT technologies sections to people whose fields encompassed the different topics chosen, James oversaw the creation of the initial website design as he had the most experience with HTML & CSS. Operating in this manner aloud for our group to function effectively is something we will look to implement in projects we are in during university.

          This group worked well together, and everyone contributed and was present for group discussions. I personally believe nothing much could have been improved however if I were to have to say anything it would be that the group needed more of a grasp of GitHub, HTML, and CSS however this is an introduction subject, so it is not a massive issue. The only other issues were many others in the group including myself fail to tart conversations about the groups work, thus showing lacking leadership skills. For me, the most surprising thing I found within this group was just how well everyone communicated as throughout my university semesters I have had group projects with people that failed to communicate as well as this group did. Also, during my work with this team, I found out just how powerful the use of Microsoft teams is as a collaborative software for group projects as it has aided the creation of our reports massively as its allowed instantiations file haring making it easier to communicate our ideas and track our progress as a group

          The group performed really well in my opinion, not just in the project work but also communication and interaction amongst one another. All group members attended the meetings and participated in group discussions and activities. This was surprising as due to my past experiences from other subjects and group assignments majority of the time it doesn’t go as smoothly as this. The group had great synergy, and in my opinion, there wasn’t anything necessarily serious that needed to be improved on, however, I would say for myself and others we needed to improve our understanding in GitHub, HTML and CSS. In this assignment it was heavily based on those skills and some of us were struggling to achieve certain outcomes we wanted on our site with the correct coding. One thing I learned about groups was that everyone had an area they were good in and used their skills to the group’s advantage, which was highlighted and foreshadowed in the personality test and learning style results and comparison. In terms of tools, we used Microsoft Teams to schedule, place, and log all of our meetings, this platform really helped us in facilitating our group discussions and the files for our project work, this is demonstrated through our recorded meetings and transcripts which show our progress throughout the project.

          I am more than confident to say that our group worked extremely well together to a high standard. Our communication within the group had a lot of professionalism and everyone was kept updated throughout the whole process. Everyone came to the scheduled meetings on time, and we all progressed well with the assignment during our meeting and during our free time. I’d say James brought a lot of creativity when it came to developing the website such as the implementation of drop boxes and tabs for all sections of the assignment. Additionally, Gurpreet and Austin brought forward a lot of group discussion and helped us overcome our fear of participating in discussion with the team especially to those who are first years. To my surprise, I found that MS teams is a very efficient way to do group assignments on as it facilitates openness such as sharing files and a chat for all of us to communicate on and schedule meetings. I’d say the most difficult part for me would be uploading my work on GitHub with HTML and CSS and it is something I'd say I'm relatively new to. Overall, I’d say this was a great learning experience in terms of working as a group on an assignment, learning how to do new things on GitHub, and how efficient MS teams is.

          Our Group worked at a high level in an extremely professional manner. We were able to organise meeting times where our group had 100% attendance in all meetings we had. I was surprised with
          the amount of professionalism in the group, usually team members are a bit scared to provide feedback but everyone in our group everyone provided open honest feedback on tasks and ensured
           everyone's work was kept to a high standard and all our deadlines within the group. In our group the areas we could improve include use of functions in teams, a lot of team members were
           still unaware of a lot of the functionality in teams which is an area that will require improvement in the future to assist in team meetings in the future.

         Overall, our group worked exceptionally well together, with our main strength being constant communication between each other and great team synergy amongst each other. What really helped was the mix between first- and third-year students as well as a mix of majors between us. Gurpreet was a third year in an IT based degree, so he took charge in delegating the work and bringing on discussion together with Austin among the rest of us group members. Although we worked great, our group could have improved on our knowledge of HTML and CSS, as it will help us when we get to the next step in our project. Both this and the next assignment heavily rely on knowledge of both HTML and CSS and especially with myself, it can be difficult to articulate and describe what we want to do with our project without a thorough understanding of the IT practices. One thing I learned about groups is that, especially in IT, a wide variety of perspectives and skills can work well in group activities, more so than I've noticed in my business degree.

          This group assignment went really well overall. Each member of our group was present for all meetings, communication was kept the whole time and clear goals and times for work to be completed were set. There were never any unrealistic deadlines or amounts of work for any individual. Even if somebody got assigned a large chunk of work someone else would join in and lend a hand. Overall, I think the work was evenly distributed. I can’t complain at all with any of the effort put in by any members of our group. We did have some struggles in certain sections, however. Overall, our groups knowledge of GitHub, HTML and CSS languages were lacking, and this section of the assignment could be difficult at times. Other than that, the only issue we had was sometimes forgetting to record our meetings. I personally had never used MS Teams before this assignment and now feel a lot more confident in using it and all the tools that come with it. When I was setting up the interview with our IT professional, I realised how useful the recording and transcript features of Teams is especially when it comes to an assignment like this.
