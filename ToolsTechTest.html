        The term cybersecurity is the practise of protecting hardware, software, networks, systems and devices from intruders. These intruders usually try to exploit systems to gain access to, change or destroy sensitive data for a multitude of reasons including monetary gains, blackmail and general business interruption. (Cisco, 2022) As the world becomes more reliant on technology, more and more data are being stored electronically hence placing a great importance on cybersecurity. A current technology/strategy being used in the cybersecurity space is Behavioural Analytics. This is the use of data that tracks how users behave on websites, apps and other systems. This can help analysts spot anomalies when it comes to a potential cyber threat as the “users’ behaviour is irregular. (The 5 Latest Cyber Security Technologies for Your Business, 2022) An example of how this could work is if analysis of user data has shown that there are unusually large amounts of data coming from one device which may potentially indicate an incoming cyber attack giving the company time to prevent it from happening and secure their data. Behavioural Analytics can be seen as more of a cybersecurity strategy rather than a new technology. As other new technologies develop, they are often incorporated into the cybersecurity space. Examples of this include Blockchain technologies, AI and cloud technology. (New Technologies In Cybersecurity | Combatting The Latest Threats, 2022) It can be difficult to pinpoint the current usage of these technologies in the cybersecurity space it is a rapidly changing one. This is due to the fact that once a technology is developed and available for use within an organisation, the technology is also then available to cyber criminals making the space a never-ending cat and mouse game between cyber criminals and organisations. The current landscape in business has change dramatically over the past few years due to the global pandemic and the switch to remote work. The use of video calling technology such as Zoom, or MS Teams has increased leading to an increase in cybersecurity concerns over things such as the use of the camera and microphone. (Milne, 2022)

    <h3> What is the likely impact?  </h3>
  </div>
    <br>
      <p>
      This comes with various cybersecurity concerns as companies can no longer rely on their own in-house cybersecurity resources and systems. This has led to an increase of targeted cyber attacks on individuals who work for big companies. (Milne, 2022) IT has become easier to target individuals at home who be lacking in cybersecurity instead of company systems. Since a lot of companies are going to keep some sort of remote work part of their routine, more spending will go into training employees in basic cybersecurity, more jobs are likely to made in the cybersecurity space and the way companies store and share data are likely to change. (Milne, 2022) Simple passwords and pins are not enough to keep data secure when it comes a well-informed, targeted cyber-attack. Cybersecurity professionals will have to change the way they operate within a business to incorporate the expansion of remote work.

    <h3> How will this affect me?  </h3>
  </div>
      <br>
      <p>
      Just about everybody was in some way shape or form impacted by the global pandemic and had to adjust to have a lot more of their lives online than ever before. It is more important than to be well educated about basic cybersecurity protocols. Remember to use 2FA (Two factor authentication) where possible, use different passwords when you can and store those passwords in a safe place. If people are not careful with these things, is it likely that if they are targeted by a cybercriminal for whatever reason, their devise or accounts will be compromised leaving you open to malware, blackmail or worse. Things such as cloud storage services like iCloud or Google drive passwords should be kept secure so that no one can sign in and steal your data such personal information, photos and files.
