      <h3> What is an Autonomous Vehicle? </h3>
    </div>
      <br>
      <div class="text_why">

      <p>
        Autonomous vehicles are cars capable of sensing their surrounding environments without the need for a passenger to operate the vehicle, bringing a passenger from the starting point to the set destination in autopilot. The current state-of-the-art of this modern technology which requires a driver to be present is Tesla who first implemented an autopilot system in September 2014 featuring auto-steer, auto-park, and traffic aware cruise control. The current state of the art of this innovative technology which does not require a driver to be present is Google’s Waymo project which began in 2009. This state-of-the-art technology allows vehicles to operate autonomously, making the frustration that comes with driving a thing of the past with the aim of decreasing deaths worldwide and reducing crashes involving human error. To improve the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate properly on the roads is to improve the condition of the roads. Not only this but due to drivers having to communicate with each other and the ability to process complex situations such as a road blockage, autonomous vehicles would need to take into account human gestures such as a wave to allow them to go first without disregarding human gestures. If not executed properly, these autonomous vehicles may become a hazard on the roads we share. Additionally, cameras may be challenged by immense amounts of sunlight reflecting on its sensors impairing the ability of automated vehicles to operate in a safe manner or laser sensors may be challenged by fog or heavy rainfall, impairing the ability to detect any nearby objects thus increasing the risk of a crash. The likely advancements for autonomous vehicles to be performed in the near future is that autonomous vehicles may implement infrared sensors to their cameras allowing them to safely operate and interact with road rules in a more efficient manner as opposed to relying solely on cameras detecting road signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians. On the other hand, if there were to be an increase in autonomous vehicles, we would need to implement smarter road signs and traffic lights to send messages to the autonomous vehicles for them to process and act on whether they should go, stop, or slow down.

  <h3> What is the likely impact?  </h3>
</div>
  <br>
      <p>
        The potential impact of this innovation is that traffic systems would increase in efficiency as road infrastructure is likely to change to head towards a fully automated world encouraging more autonomous vehicles to be put in use. This will cause less traffic congestion leading to smoother traffic flow. This in turn would lower carbon emissions leading to a more economically sustainable future. Additionally, due to more cars being autonomous, there will be a rapid reduction in road deaths per year given that automated vehicles have a lower likelihood of getting into a fatal crash in comparison to human error. Furthermore, society will see a rapid decline in Taxis and Ubers being operated by a human due to autonomous vehicles being the new future. This will cause a ripple effect as Taxi and Uber operators will be made redundant which in turn may possibly increase the homeless rate if Taxi and Uber operators solely relies on their job as their only source of income However, this will give rise to many urban planners, developer, construction worker and AV technicians roles for the city to build a new economically sustainable future.

      <div class="heading_container heading_center">
        <h3> How will this affect me?  </h3>
      </div>
          <br>
      <p>
        The impact of autonomous vehicles will not only affect me as an individual but will likely affect other lives as well. The auto industry will most likely shift from private to public in which the rate of people owning a car will reduce rapidly due to people being able to hail a fully autonomous vehicle to pick them up from point A to point B with the touch of a button. Additionally, this will cause a ripple effect which will cause private car dealerships to shut down due to no one buying any more cars which in turn will urge insurance companies to surge their insurance prices as well as fuel prices due to the possibility of the future using strictly electric cars and no longer fuel powered cars. This will affect many campers as well as myself, as some enjoy going out in nature for a camping or fishing trip and with the use of autonomous vehicles, it would take away all the fun from it as, many fishing gear and equipment would need to be packed and stored away from the elements. Furthermore, the likelihood of “autonomous vehicles” making it through rough terrain would be highly unlikely. However, on the upside, those who aren't adventurers would reap the benefits of autonomous vehicles as they would not need to worry about the troubles of owning their own cars when traveling long distances.
