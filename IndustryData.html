          The group’s ideal jobs and their current demand in Australia are presented in Table (Teams Ideal Employer Demand Comparison) above, the information retrieved from Labour Market Insights provide an understanding of the current and forecasted level of employment growth for years to come. This data helps us see the trend towards major growth in particular industries such as the professional, scientific and technical services of which jobs such as the cyber security analyst, software developer, business analyst, content coordinator, and electronics engineer largely operate in. The table also tells us that the top-ranking jobs in terms of demand from employers have a very strong employment growth rate and outlook for the future (Labour Market Insights 2022), these being cyber security analyst and software developer.

<h5>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?  </h5>

      </div>
<div class="text_why">
        <br>
        <p>
          Well, the group shows interest in jobs relating to cyber security, business analytics and other I.T related jobs such as electronic engineer and these industries and jobs require in demand skills such as SQL coding for databases which ranks extremely high alongside networking, cloud computing and technical support-based skills meaning the groups IT specific skills required for their desired jobs are in high demand from employers.
          <br> <br>
          When talking about the ranking for required IT skill sets against employer demand, within the group it is shown that skills of cloud computing, system and network monitoring, programming, and coding tend to be the top skills in demand by the industries with the highest employment growth rate. Although these IT specific skills are sought after in jobs with high demand, these IT skills are still relevant across other ideal jobs within the group even though they may not have the highest demand from employers, e.g., electrical engineers still require cloud computing, programming, and network monitoring and security as part of their IT skill requirements.

<h5>
  How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</h5>
</div>
<div class="text_why">
        <br>
        <p>
The general skills required across all the ideal jobs was found to be very much like one another, this can be due to the fact that working in a professional workspace requires strong communication skills across the board whether that be internal or external to the organisation, as well as possessing skills of critical thinking, organisational skills, and complex problem solving. Labour Market Insights (2022) lists all the ideal jobs as “very high skill” and the general skill of critical thinking is ranked very highly in terms of demand from employers, it is frequently mentioned as a required skill in each industry no matter if it was IT specific or not. Moreover, comprehension, evaluation and analysis skills were ranked amongst the top general skills within each job.

<h5>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h5>



</div>
<div class="text_why">
<p>
  When looking into the Burning Glass data recorded between March 2017 to February 2018 it is safe to say that the general skills in the greatest demand have not changed very much over the last few years, as skills of communication, problem solving, organisational skills, and teamwork are still the main top in-demand attributes sought by employers today (Labour Market Insights 2022). However, when looking into the specialised skills of IT the data shown in 2017-2018 reveals that SQL, JavaScript, Microsoft Windows, and Java were the greatest in demand, in comparison to today, Java, SQL and related database skills are still in high demand, but cloud computing and network related skills are emerging as more sought-after skills, which is something the group should take notice of.
</p>

<h5>
Has the teams opinion changed on their ideal job? Why or why not?
</h5>
</div>
<div class="text_why">
        <br>
        <p>
The overall consensus of the group’s ideal jobs is that everyone's opinion on their desired field and future work has not changed, as for many of the group such as James, Jason T and Austin they all have work that requires desirable employee I.T skills from employers. For Jason D and Tommy, they still hold the desire to work in their ideal jobs however, unlike the rest of the group they are focused on developing business related skills with them studying business degrees at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) whereas the rest of the group have I.T based degrees they are studying. However, this doesn’t mean I.T skills aren’t relevant to Jason D and Tommy, digital integration and I.T skill demand are progressively increasing within all industries (National Skills Commission 2021) and by upskilling and keeping up to date on industry technologies, systems, services and the technical skills required to effectively use them would allow us to be advantageous and excel in our positions.  Additionally, out of the whole group, Gurpreet’s chosen field shows the least amount of growth projected over the coming years, however due to his aspirations on serving he has chosen to stay on his current career path as within the RAAF this job position is still highly sought after.         </p>
