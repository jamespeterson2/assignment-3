        The following is a gaant chart which outlines the timeline which the project worked upon; it is accurate as of the 18/10/22. Even though we were supposed to follow a weekly
        timeline we found that with it being the end of the semester everyone had many deadlines incoming from different projects we decided that setting clear goals for everyone
        to work on at the beginning of the project helped the team to better manage their time and achieve the outcome of a finished project.

        With the amount of work done in prototyping of the website and the web scrapping program which are showcased in the report the development that is needed wonâ€™t require the extra 10 weeks that are given to reach deployment. With a clear and concise plan on what needs to be achieved and with the no other work (ie other assignments) being done alongside the development, just a little over a month is what we predict we will need to finish the scholafind Product. This will allow us to have a couple weeks to test the product and have a finished product by Christmas which is a perfect time to release the product with students who have graduated VCE having received their first round offers from schools and are contemplating their futures.

    </div>

      <p>
        We decided to use python to code our web scraping program which could potentially prove to be difficult as we are not sure if we have the required knowledge to make such a program. We could have issues with our code and not be able to correctly troubleshoot. Python may even turn out to not be the most effective tool to develop a web scraping program but at this point, we are not sure, so this is definitely a risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also ethical considerations to think about. It needs to be clear with what data we are actually scraping. Transparency with both users and the places that we are scraping data from should be fully aware of our use of the data. A risk that we also run is making sure the program is coded correctly to avoid any unexpected issues. An issue that is a particularly big risk is making sure we don't accidentally perform a denial-of-service attack (DoS). As web scraping programs commonly send the server hosting the site many requests to access its different data, this can use up the server resources and potentially lock out users from accessing the site which is not something we want to do.
