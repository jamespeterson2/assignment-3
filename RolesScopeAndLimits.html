        <h4>  What is the likely impact </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
      As machine learning continues to develop and although it has made life easier for us, implementing machine learning into business has raised a few ethical concerns surrounding A.I. The impact A.I will have on jobs is massive, as we introduce disruptive new technology, we shift the market demand for specific job roles (IBM, 2020). As artificial intelligence shifts demand of jobs to other areas as there will need to be individuals to manage these systems as data sets change and grow, some jobs will be lost to the fact that they can become autonomous with machine learning, and this is seen withing industries such as customer service. Customer service will shift to become more about working to make sure data is inputted into the systems for A.I to work. Although this may seem worrying it shouldn't be as with the introduction of machine learning and the vastly growing reliance on data and the vastly growing scale of data sets there is also a growing job demand for people that can manage these new systems, meaning A.I is creating more jobs and the important aspect of artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping individuals transition to these new areas of market demand (Singh, 2020). When looking at the impact that machine learning will have on the world, we see how big of a difference this will make on society as it will affect everything from healthcare services, education, transport, housing, entertainment, cars and more as this type of technology aims to create more efficient, effective, and accurate ways of doing things meaning it could change the world for the better as we move more forward into developing technology (Singh, 2020).

        <h4>  How Will this Affect Me </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        Personally, machine learning to me seems to be working to make my life easier as I use it every day in many tasks including the very program, I have used to write this report as within Microsoft teams and word, machine learning was used to create it text prediction and its grammar and spelling correction system. I also use it when searching on YouTube as the recommended videos it sends me tend to be accurate it what I want to watch, and I utilize it within my car for text to speech when driving to input destinations into maps for navigation and for texting people without pulling my phone out. Another large reason for me believing it will benefit me is because I am aiming to get a business analyst job which uses big data to create forecasts and prediction based around businesses performance and these forecasts are derived from A.I and machine learning algorithms meaning that I will be using machine learning algorithms in my potential future career. Overall machine learning for me tends to be a positive impact on my life through my daily tasks including on and off work.
