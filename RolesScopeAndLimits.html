  Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (A.I) and computer science which utilizes data and complex algorithms to imitate how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy as it goes on. This type of A.I is used around us in many ways already however as time goes on and technology improves and computers and systems become more powerful, machine learning can then become much more relevant, useful and accurate. This can be seen through IBM’s first interaction with artificial intelligence where an employee of IBM Arthur Samuel lost a game of checkers to a machine running on a computer from 1962, however with the decades of technological improvements machine learning has been introduced to much higher levels of processing power and storage systems alongside better algorithms that now A.I is seen within products we know such as Netflix’s recommendation engine and even Tesla’s self-driving car systems. For machine learning to work there are three main parts. The first part is the decision process which involves classifications and predictions being made about the specific input data set, which can be unlabelled or labelled through the algorithm. Through these classifications the algorithm will produce patterns within the data. The seconded key part is an error function which serves to evaluate the prediction of the model/algorithm. Here the algorithm can cross check it with an example and the accuracy of the model can then be assessed. The final key part is a model optimization process, here the model will be changed to see if it can fit the data points in the training set or example. To do this, weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model. The model will continuously be changing as the algorithm changes these weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been reached, overall making the algorithm more effective. There are also three types of machine learning including supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning and semi-supervised learning. Supervised learning involves labelled datasets to train the algorithm to classify data accurately, an example of this is the system that classifies spam email and separates them into a different folder as it requires users to sometimes report email as spam so it can learn what emails are spam. Unsupervised learning is when an algorithm can create a model without the interaction of humans. This type of machine learning can find hidden patterns within data groupings all on its own (IBM, 2020). The semi-supervised learning systems are a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning as t uses a smaller labelled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabelled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of having not enough labelled data (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm (Coursera, 2022). Some real-world machine learning use cases that are used every day are things such as speech recognition which utilizes machine learning with natural language processing to process human speech into a written format, this type of A.I is seen in mobile phones such as Bixby and Siri. Another use for machine learning is automated stock trading which discover patterns within data sets pulled form stocks performance and this type of A.I makes millions of trades per day without human intervention.

        <h4>  What is the likely impact </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
      As machine learning continues to develop and although it has made life easier for us, implementing machine learning into business has raised a few ethical concerns surrounding A.I. The impact A.I will have on jobs is massive, as we introduce disruptive new technology, we shift the market demand for specific job roles (IBM, 2020). As artificial intelligence shifts demand of jobs to other areas as there will need to be individuals to manage these systems as data sets change and grow, some jobs will be lost to the fact that they can become autonomous with machine learning, and this is seen withing industries such as customer service. Customer service will shift to become more about working to make sure data is inputted into the systems for A.I to work. Although this may seem worrying it shouldn't be as with the introduction of machine learning and the vastly growing reliance on data and the vastly growing scale of data sets there is also a growing job demand for people that can manage these new systems, meaning A.I is creating more jobs and the important aspect of artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping individuals transition to these new areas of market demand (Singh, 2020). When looking at the impact that machine learning will have on the world, we see how big of a difference this will make on society as it will affect everything from healthcare services, education, transport, housing, entertainment, cars and more as this type of technology aims to create more efficient, effective, and accurate ways of doing things meaning it could change the world for the better as we move more forward into developing technology (Singh, 2020).

        <h4>  How Will this Affect Me </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        Personally, machine learning to me seems to be working to make my life easier as I use it every day in many tasks including the very program, I have used to write this report as within Microsoft teams and word, machine learning was used to create it text prediction and its grammar and spelling correction system. I also use it when searching on YouTube as the recommended videos it sends me tend to be accurate it what I want to watch, and I utilize it within my car for text to speech when driving to input destinations into maps for navigation and for texting people without pulling my phone out. Another large reason for me believing it will benefit me is because I am aiming to get a business analyst job which uses big data to create forecasts and prediction based around businesses performance and these forecasts are derived from A.I and machine learning algorithms meaning that I will be using machine learning algorithms in my potential future career. Overall machine learning for me tends to be a positive impact on my life through my daily tasks including on and off work.
