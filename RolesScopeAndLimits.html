      <p>
      ScholaFinda will develop a database for all scholarships offered only by RMIT at this point in time. The goal of the database is to allow users to input their personal criteria and have the data refined to their own personalised criteria in order to efficiently analyse their own eligibility.
      </p>

    <p><u>  Project deliverables: </u></p>


    <ul>
      <li>Create a database to store scholarship data which will be collected through web scraping software or python.  </li>
      <li>Create a website using Proto. Io in which the user can search the database for scholarships within RMIT.  </li>
      <li>Allow for personal criteria to be inputted by the user in order to enable the database to refine scholarship data to the user's eligibility.  </li>
    </ul>

    <p><u><i>Limitations:</p></u></i>

    <ul>
      <li>Limited knowledge of coding and web scraping and python   </li>
      <li>Lack of Financing. Most programs used were free  </li>
      <li>Time: the entire project was created in roughly 12 weeks   </li>
      <li>Only RMIT, Vic University and Monash data used due to time constraints although only RMIT was done with a python script.    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The main limitation that impacted the project was the small window of time it needed to be completed in. From the project's initial planning stage to the creation of the deliverables was a total of approximately 12 weeks total time the project was given for completion. This lack of allocated time led to other limitations such as the deliverables only scraping and offering data for RMIT based scholarships. Other limitations the project encountered was the group's limited knowledge of operating web scraping and python's significance in the operation of the software. As many of the individuals in the group have limited knowledge of python, valuable time was spent learning how to operate the web scraping software which has been better used in gathering more scholarship data. Lastly, due to a lack of financing, the project aimed to always use free software to create the deliverables.
