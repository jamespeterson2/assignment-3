        Name: Deb Nelson

        Company: Microsoft

        Position: Customer Success Account Manager

        <p>
        Our group decided to interview Deb Nelson who works in the IT industry at Microsoft and has been with the company for about 18 months. She has worked at various other companies including Coles-Myer, NCR, Medibank and Ricoh. Her role at Microsoft is as a Customer Success Account Manager whose main priority is in the education department with many ongoing projects with schools and universities through the Victorian Education department. She describes this position as “a glorified title for a service delivery manager”. This position is responsible for making sure that customers and clients are satisfied with the service or product being delivered by a company. This entails the management of project teams and direct customer interaction.
      </p>
        <p>
        Being in this position, Deb interacts with many different IT professionals including “non-technical IT people and very technical people that know the ins and outs all the platforms being used and the application and integration of these platforms” One key takeaway from our interview with Deb was the attention a lot of the IT department has on making data and platforms accessible to everyone of all abilities. Deb mentioned that the pandemic put an emphasis on accessibility as you have people work may have for example visual impairments such as colour-blindness or even hearing impairments. She spoke of how Microsoft had updated MS Teams to have features such as transcripts so that the hearing impaired could still be present in meetings. Other features that were developed to help with accessibility include dictation and suggestions to change colour palettes on presentations for the sake of accessibility for the visually impaired.
      </p>
        <p>
        Deb works as a full-time employee at Microsoft so that means 5 days a week of working however, this entails both remote work and going into the office so her week is usually quite flexible. A general day to day for Deb involves brining all the people that are part of a project team together to make sure that goals when it comes to delivering a product to a customer are met. Deb mentioned that it can be difficult when working in such a large company to find the right people from the right departments to assist with what needs to be done. Another important aspect of Deb’s Day to day is customer interaction as she describes herself as “the main port of call for the business, so anything that they (the customers/clients) want to do that’s Microsoft related, they will come to me in the first instance” With issues that are directly involved with the customers, she either delegates tasks onto her team or personally handles it herself. When it comes to dealing with customers and clients Deb told us that the most important skill is the ability to listen. Letting people vent, whether it’s a co worker at Microsoft or a customer is key to maintain healthy relationships. Sometimes people get frustrated and that’s okay as long as they can hash it out and move forward from there.
      </p>
        <p>
        Deb has been into IT for quite some time. She says that she has loves IT and “what it can do and make people’s lives easier” Since Deb has only been at Microsoft for about 18 months, when asked what the most difficult aspect of her job is she said that it was “just knowing where to find the right answers because it's such a big organization.” Most of her challenges that she mentioned mainly had to do with being new at such a large company. On the other hand, when Deb was asked what was most enjoyable about her job is the relationships she makes with the various stakeholders. Deb mentioned that the IT space has changed significantly over the years says the part that interests and affects her the most now is the hybrid learning space and how accessible education is nowadays.
      </p>
        <p>
        Deb gave us some advice for people heading into a career in IT. She believes that everyone should have knowledge on how cloud computing works and the application of that within a business. She stressed the importance of the cloud and how organisations no longer need to spend a lot of money on hardware and servers instead relying on cloud computing. Some general career advice Deb provided us with was to just have a willingness to learn. This is especially important when it comes to the IT field as it’s a field that will always be rapidly changing with technological developments. Deb states that she also believes that AI is going to change the IT space in the very near future so that’s something to keep in mind when it comes to career in IT. As a final thought, Deb left us with saying that “If anything the advice that I can give you is. Concentrate on cybersecurity because that is the definite future.”
