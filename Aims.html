      <p>

        The plan of the project is to illustrate the feasibility of creating a fully functioning website which offers the user the ability to input their own hardship criteria in order to filter out any scholarships that the user is ineligible to receive, saving the user an extensive amount of time on research into their own eligibility.
      </p>
      <p>
      As each individual university within Australia offers its own university exclusive scholarships with differing criteria to applicants each year. Due to the large amounts of scholarship available, it can be time consuming for applicants to research and find scholarships in which they are eligible based on the eligibility criteria. As such, it is the aim of the project to provide users with the ability to refine the scholarship data based on their own personal criteria. In order to successfully source the data needed for the website, scholarship data will need to be collected in addition to designing a fully functioning website for users to input their individual criteria or refine the data.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to achieve this outcome, many smaller goals will need to be established in order to feasibly create the ScholaFinda website.
      </p>
      <p>
      The most important goal for the creation of the website is to collect the scholarship data. Monash, Victoria University and RMIT were the three chosen universities to begin compiling data for the project. However, as time constraints may become an issue, RMIT data will be prioritised due to each group member's familiarity with the university being students at the college. The scholarship data will be collected through the use of python script in order to act as a web scraper and collect data. BeautifulSoup, a python package, will be used in order to parse the HTML text within the chosen universities websites in order to collect the scholarship data contained within. The collected data will then be stored as CSV files on a shared GitHub repository. Due to time constraints, group members can instead fall back on using the software WebScraper in order to collect the scholarship data required in a limited amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
    Parsing and collecting the scholarship data will take priority over the website prototyping, as if there is no data available for users to search for the website has no purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
    A website will need to be designed in order to allow for users to input their own hardship criteria in order to refine the data. To do so, Proto.Io a prototyping application platform will be utilised. The entire website will be designed based on the site map as a starting point. The entire website will be prototyped as if it were fully functional, showcasing each feature the user will be able to enjoy as well as design choices such as web page images as well as potential university data for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If successful, the project will offer a single database in which users can research whether they are eligible for certain scholarships and grants without having to do extensive research. Upon completion the database should allow the user to input their pre-defined, personal criteria in order to refine their search into scholarships to showcase only those that they are eligible to apply.
