          <h3> Topic </h3>
      <p>
        The idea and proposal of the project is to build a website and intermediary for students (users) that will assist them in finding the best available and applicable scholarships to apply for during their studies in higher education. Scholarships are beneficial to students as they can reduce the financial burden and pressures of life during their studies, it can allow them extra time and space away from working and to focus on furthering their education and career related skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within the scope, the project group aims to develop a website with an inviting and simple user experience, the website will house web content that will provide users a full understanding of the purpose and advantages to using the site to discover scholarships available to them. Moreover, the website’s main function would be to provide tailored results based on info, filters and categories selected by the user. The results delivered would allow the user to click-on an external link and be sent directly to the scholarship’s details and application page. These results will come from a database that is filled by the web scraping software whose role is to retrieve the necessary data from university’s websites, this would be for example the scholarships’ description, eligibility criteria, and application page URL. This whole process will involve a number of APIs integrated alongside the web scraping software and database, which ultimately tells us there will be a need for certain key roles in order to make the project successful; content specialists, front-end and back-end developer roles and skills within programming and coding are critical to the project, alongside graphical and user experience development elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The big picture of this project would be to provide this service in the form of a fully operational website with numerous functions of filters, categorisation, search tab, user accounts, saved profiles, and a self-submission feature, all of which would be free access to students. In the grand scale of things, another objective to achieve would be scaling the capabilities to being able to display all the scholarships available across every state and university within Australia. This ideal website should also be able to handle high volumes of requests and users in quick succession and provide the latest information online, this can be achieved on a longer timescale and with more resources like cloud-based solutions, however, with constraints on time, skill, knowledge, and budget the current overview of the project currently focuses on delivering results based on RMIT university’s available scholarships for RMIT students.

<h3> Landscape </h3>
<p>
  Our website if developed would be unique in the Australian market. There are some websites particularly in the USA where college scholarships at various colleges can be searched for with different filters. This being said those filters were not the same as ours. An example of one of these site would be scholarshipportal.com. This is not the case in Australia, however. Almost all the websites we could find that you could search for university scholarships on could only be filtered by field of study. Our site has a lot more specific filters and therefore tailored search results for the user making our product stand from the current landscape.
