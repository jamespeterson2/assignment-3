        Our product will be built around a website that will allow potential students to be able to easily find the scholarships which they need in order to pursue their ambitions and join a university. It will aim to provide an easy-to-use interface where potential students can quickly search keywords or create a personalised account that allows them to view a range of scholarships that match each of their unique circumstances. It will be a one-stop shop where they can get all their information on the scholarships, they want to and can apply for without needing to conduct extensive research and wasting time researching scholarships which they have no chance in landing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website will use web scraping software to form a database of all the different scholarships that are available. The website will provide a tool for users to access this data and resolve their queries. The website will allow users to search for different scholarships using different predefined parameters to assist in the search, these include;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locational Filters specifically Filtering By State </li>
        <li>Filter By Specific scholarship type </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The specific filters include;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access and Equity Scholarships </li>
        <li>Access to Accommodation scholarships </li>
        <li>Achievement and Academic Based Scholarships </li>
        <li>Scholarships for International study </li>
        <li>Scholarships for Women</li>
        <li>Scholarships for First Nation Peoples</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With the use of Proto.io we created a prototype website that will be used to model the design of the actual website once its development begins. The current prototype website contains a home page, profile page, preferences page, search box and a simple login/sign up page.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/Homescreen.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The picture above shows the home page of the website that was designed, it was aimed to be kept simple but also allow for the users to have a quick experience wasting as little time as possible. From the home page, users can navigate to the search, settings, login and saved scholarships pages at a click of a button. They can also complete a quick search from the parameters shown above and find scholarships based on the top universities or by certain states in Australia. The home page will also contain an option where potential users can quickly sign up for the website and create an account the benefits of which are discussed below. This page will also contain reviews and user experiences which will help build trust and rapport with users by sharing the positive experiences of other users to give them comfort in trust in our website.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/info.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The settings tab on the home page will transport the user to the settings personal information tab which is shown in the screenshot above. This tab has a generalised form that is used to collate the information of users. Whilst this form wonâ€™t be necessary barring the email address the information could aid in helping meet the preferences shown on the next page.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/pref.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The next page on the settings page has the personal preferences which a user can assign to quickly access scholarships that meet their individual requirements. These preferences are then saved which will allow the users to quickly search for scholarships filtering out searches that do not apply to them. This feature is showcased on the search page which is shown below.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/search.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The search tab will provide users who have signed up and those who haven't, to pick and choose through all the filters which are provided to search for different scholarships. This page also allows users that have made accounts to access the quick search feature which takes the preferences which were saved in the settings to be quickly accessed and filter out results to the users liking. This page will also show saved scholarships of account holders with a brief description so they can quickly access the searches which they have saved. These will also have a separate page having a brief summary of the saved scholarships will help users compare their new searches and aid in deciding on which one they would apply for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also designed simple login and account signup pages which are general designs found on most websites however these will allow users to create accounts using details which they have saved on for other platforms in order to cut down the time and effort required to join the website.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/login.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      <br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class ="under_text">
        <img src="images/signup.PNG" width="700" height="350"></a>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This design will help web developers in creating a website which reaches the outcomes which we have envisioned the project achieving for the users that use it. The pages that are not shown on this include the password reset page which will just use the same shell of what is used on most other websites and the list of saved scholarships will just provide an overview with descriptions of each scholarship the user has bookmarked for quick and easy access.
