        Our product will be built around a website that will allow potential students to be able to easily find the scholarships which they need in order to pursue their ambitions and join a university. It will aim to provide an easy-to-use interface where potential students can quickly search keywords or create a personalised account that allows them to view a range of scholarships that match each of their unique circumstances. It will be a one-stop shop where they can get all their information on the scholarships, they want to and can apply for without needing to conduct extensive research and wasting time researching scholarships which they have no chance in landing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website will use web scraping software to form a database of all the different scholarships that are available. The website will provide a tool for users to access this data and resolve their queries. The website will allow users to search for different scholarships using different predefined parameters to assist in the search, these include;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locational Filters specifically Filtering By State </li>
        <li>Filter By Specific scholarship type </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The specific filters include;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access and Equity Scholarships </li>
        <li>Access to Accommodation scholarships </li>
        <li>Achievement and Academic Based Scholarships </li>
        <li>Scholarships for International study </li>
        <li>Scholarships for Women</li>
        <li>Scholarships for First Nation Peoples</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With the use of Proto.io we created a prototype website that will be used to model the design of the actual website once its development begins. The current prototype website contains a home page, profile page, preferences page, search box and a simple login/sign up page.
      </p>

        The picture above shows the home page of the website that was designed, it was aimed to be kept simple but also allow for the users to have a quick experience wasting as little time as possible. From the home page, users can navigate to the search, settings, login and saved scholarships pages at a click of a button. They can also complete a quick search from the parameters shown above and find scholarships based on the top universities or by certain states in Australia. The home page will also contain an option where potential users can quickly sign up for the website and create an account the benefits of which are discussed below. This page will also contain reviews and user experiences which will help build trust and rapport with users by sharing the positive experiences of other users to give them comfort in trust in our website.

      <div class ="text_why">
      <p>
        The settings tab on the home page will transport the user to the settings personal information tab which is shown in the screenshot above. This tab has a generalised form that is used to collate the information of users. Whilst this form won’t be necessary barring the email address the information could aid in helping meet the preferences shown on the next page.

      <p>
        The next page on the settings page has the personal preferences which a user can assign to quickly access scholarships that meet their individual requirements. These preferences are then saved which will allow the users to quickly search for scholarships filtering out searches that do not apply to them. This feature is showcased on the search page which is shown bel400

      <p>
        The search tab will provide users who have signed up and those who haven't, to pick and choose through all the filters which are provided to search for different scholarships. This page also allows users that have made accounts to access the quick search feature which takes the preferences which were saved in the settings to be quickly accessed and filter out results to the users liking. This page will also show saved scholarships of account holders with a brief description so they can quickly access the searches which they have saved. These will also have a separate page having a brief summary of the saved scholarships will help users compare their new searches and aid in deciding on which one they would apply for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also designed simple login and account signup pages which are general designs found on most websites however these will allow users to create accounts using details which they have saved on for other platforms in order to cut down the time and effort required to join the website.

        This design will help web developers in creating a website which reaches the outcomes which we have envisioned the project achieving for the users that use it. The pages that are not shown on this include the password reset page which will just use the same shell of what is used on most other websites and the list of saved scholarships will just provide an overview with descriptions of each scholarship the user has bookmarked for quick and easy access.

      <h4>
      Web Scrapping Program
    </h4>
    </div>
    <div class ="text_why">
<p>

Two methods will be used to compile data on scholarships. For some websites, a python script can be used but as a result of some confusing coding conventions used on some web pages a WebScrape program can be used to better extract data. Both these methods will export the data into a CSV file. The CSV files will then need to be converted using Java Script into JSON then it can all be formatted using HTML and CSS in a way that makes it much easier to read for users.

    <br>
    <div class ="text_why">
<p>

The above image highlights how the RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) scholarships were obtained using a python script. After that the data was then converted into a CSV file called “Scholarships” as shown by the code above.

</p>

<p><i>Sample of the RMIT scholarships CSV file</i></p>
</div>
<div class ="text_why">
<p>
The image above is the final product of running the python webscrape script on the RMIT scholarships page. For the second method of using a chrome extension-based software to webscrape scholarship information, the same result of a CSV file containing the data will occur.

<p><i>WebScraper Chrome extention being used</i></p>

<div class ="text_why">
<p>
This image here displays how data was scraped using the WebScraper extension on Chrome. This extension is found within the inspect element feature present on chrome and many other search engines. Within the software a set out process is created by the us and each bit of information is then harvested and exported as a CSV file.

<p><i>Layout of process the WebScraper will undergo when harvesting data</i></p>
</div>
<div class ="text_why">
<p>
The listed image above is the process of how the software goes through each link on each page and scrapes the desired information. The next required part for the project to become a finished product is for the CSV files information to be presented on a website for the user. To do this the CSV files were then converted to JSON using JavaScript.
</p>
</div>
<div class ="under_text">

<p><i>Sample code of how the CSV files will be converted to JSON and the layout of the data on a web page side-by-side</i></p>
</div>
<div class ="text_why">
<p>
As depicted in the image above, Java was used to turn any selected CSV files into JSON. This was a necessity as without doing this the information couldn’t be formatted and styled with CSS, and it wouldn’t have been possible to then show the data on a website page using HTML.
</p>
</div>



    <div class="heading_container heading_center">
      <h4>
      What's left to do
    </h4>
    </div>
    <div class ="text_why">
<p>
  For the program to become a polished final product the CSV files will need to be better formatted with certain parts of information such as page links needing to be removed from being viewed and then converted to a hidden hyperlink attached to the cell of the scholarship allowing users to be able to go straight to the webpage showing more information about the scholarship. There would also need to be a searching function that allows the scraped data to be sorted through by user preferences. We would also obviously need to code the prototype website and combine the CSV files with the scholarship information.
  <br> <br>
  Besides from the more technical work, with most of our group members not being gifted in the arts we need to develop a logo which the scholafind product can be represented by. As none of our group members have experience in design, if the project was to continue this work will be outsourced and will be overseen by Tommy who has a marketing background to ensure that the design is feasible enough to be used with our product.
