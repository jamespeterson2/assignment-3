        The term cloud computing refers to the delivery of various computing services over the Internet, which refers to the cloud in this case. These services include databases,
        software-defined computing/networks, and servers. This style of technology provides flexibility to companies allowing them to create virtual offices which ich let them
        create virtual offices which allow people to connect to them from anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various components of the cloud computing platform can be broken down into various categories depending on what they are used for and the technology stacks, these
        services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the types of cloud services is Infrastructure as a Service, it provides a variety of virtual storage, networking, and compute resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
        IaaS is a type of cloud computing that enables the provider to manage various IT infrastructures such as servers, storage, and networking resources which are delivered
        to subscribers through virtual machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        IaaS is a type of cloud computing that allows organizations to operate their workloads more efficiently and effectively as they do not have to buy and implement the infrastructure
        and can simply use existing infrastructure from other companies cutting down costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Platform as a service, or PaaS, is a type of cloud computing model that enables third-party providers to deliver software and hardware to users through the internet. Unlike
        traditional IT infrastructure, PaaS does not replace an organization's entire software development infrastructure. Instead, it allows them to access a wide range of services
        through the internet. Some of the services that PaaS can provide include Java development and application hosting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of cloud computing which is most prevalent in daily life is SaaS. Software as a service is a type of distribution model that enables the different cloud providers to
        make their applications available to end users, who can access the applications via any device that has an internet connection. The software providers who provide said applications
        and services can use their own resources to host users or contract cloud providers to host the products for them. Saas uses application service providers (ASP) and software on demand
        to provide customers with their software. Software-on-demand models allow customers to access a single copy of a particular application that the provider has created for the distribution
        of their SaaS. One instance of an application will run on a single host server and this instance will serve as the primary instance for each cloud tenant and customer, this is
        how SaaS uses the multi-tenant model to provide a service for multiple people. It eliminates the need for organizations to run applications on their own hardware or in their data centres,
        drastically cutting costs for companies taking away the need for hardware, maintenance and providing installation services to customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table below shows an overview of how the different types of cloud computing are used by enterprises and providers.
        <br>
        <img src="cloud.png" width="700" height="260"></a>
        <br>
        In the modern world cloud computing provides a solution that is fast and reliable, and it eliminates the need for additional hardware for companies looking to implement applications.
        Its limited maintenance and ease of installation make it ideal for small and medium-sized businesses. Currently we can see cloud computing used for;
      </p>
    <h4> Cloud Storage:  </h4>
      <p>
        Data that is stored in the cloud can be accessed, stored, and retrieved from any computer with an Internet connection. One of the main reasons why cloud storage is very appealing
        when compared to other storage techniques is that it allows users to access and edit their files easily. Just a simple internet connection is required to access these files.
        In the modern world, we can see cloud storage used in iCloud, OneDrive, and Google Drive.
      </p>
    <h4> Big Data Analytics: </h4>
      <p>
        SaaS is commonly used by cloud computing providers to allow their customers to process their data. These models typically come with a console that can handle various commands
        and parameters, but everything can be done through the user interface. Big Data is typically generated by a network-based system. It can be formatted in various non-standard formats.
        With the help of machine learning, cloud computing providers can then use artificial intelligence to analyse and improve the data. By using the two in conjunction allows organizations
        to analyse and improve their data in a fraction of the time they used to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cloud computing is also commonly utilised in Data backups, Disaster recovery, Software testing and development and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rise of the cloud has shifted the focus of the IT industry from an emerging trend to an essential resource Its ability to provide secure and on-demand computing resources has also
        changed the way organizations think about IT. Developments being made into faster internet networks such as 5G and Wi-Fi 6E will allow for even more development into cloud computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With advances in network technology, the advancements in cloud computing will follow soon behind. These increases could see the implementation of a new platform of cloud virtual and
        augmented reality (VR/AR). Developments in these technologies have been shown in Facebook Horizon which is a new cloud platform that will allow people to interact with each other and
        access the cloud through virtual reality. With the cloud being able to handle substantial amounts of data and bandwidth requirements for end users, advancements in machine learning and
        AI (Artificial Intelligence) which require substantial amounts of bandwidth and processing power these tools are usually implemented in cloud networks allowing for them to be used anytime
        anywhere without the requirements of edge users being too high. Therefore, advancements in cloud computing and Machine learning will be intertwined with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to automate various operations has become a key component of cloud computing. With the right cloud environment, organizations can easily achieve efficiency gains and reduce their
        costs. With improvements in the cloud, companies will see a rise in automation in companies with a cutdown in internal operations as a result.
      </p>
    <h3> What is the likely impact:  </h3>
    <br>
      <p>
        According to Gartner, spending on infrastructure software and business process services will increase significantly by 2025. The analyst firm predicts that by 2025, around half of all spending
        on these products will be allocated to the cloud and around 67% of spending to on applications to be around cloud apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the increasing popularity of cloud computing, it is expected that the technology will create over 700,000 jobs in the next five years. According to a study conducted by Sand Hill Group,
        companies that provide cloud-based services are expected to receive around $20 billion in annual revenue on average over the next 5 years. However, with this growth In-house IT positions are
        expected to be affected by the shift to the cloud. As organizations move their network services to the cloud, and their IT networks are shifted to cloud providers companies will no longer
        require the services of in-house database and systems administrators and help desk support staff as cloud networks will be outsourced to outside cloud providers. Even though companies will
        not require these staff a lot of these workers will be sought out by cloud providers to perform these operations for them. One of the fields that will grow immensely is security, with mobile
        and cloud computing becoming more prevalent users can use multiple devices connected to various networks to connect to a single cloud network which can cause problems. According to a study
        conducted by Statista in 2020, 75% of businesses are concerned about the security of their public cloud and only 1% show no concern, these statistics show that there will undoubtedly be a rise
        in the demand for people with cloud securities skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this technology taking over many current IT professionals who work with the IT infrastructure will need to reskill and move to obtain new knowledge on cloud technologies to not be
        left behind by the new shift in the way companies connect and operate.
      </p>
    <h3> How will this affect me:  </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Cloud infrastructure works in the background of many network devices with the benefits almost going unnoticed by the public who utilise the technology. In recent times we have seen cloud
         storage solutions such as iCloud completely remove the storage issues many of us experienced by most of us in the past. By moving most of our network and computing resources to the cloud
         we will remove the need for big devices which use lots of data and computing power from end users. This transition will see people being able to run applications and have feature which would
         require large computers at the touch of a button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally (Gurpreet SIdhu), with my qualifications in computer and network engineering, I will be directly impacted by advances in cloud computing. I will look to choose electives that will
        give me knowledge of cloud technologies. I will also look to get certifications that will assist in my employability these include but are not limited to certifications that show employers I
        am competent with the use of AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) cloud technologies.
