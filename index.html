            I am Gurpreet Sidhu; I am currently studying Computer and Network engineering at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Whilst I was born and raised in Australia I identify as an Australian Indian as both my parents migrated from Punjab. As well to English I am fluent in Punjabi in both Speaking and listening. My Interests in IT (Information Technology) are within internet services, specifically the networks which provide them. Australia is renowned for being a developed country with internet connectivity and speeds that perform well below the levels of other developed countries. Growing up I remember having to keep my PlayStation on over the weekend to download NBA 2k via my Wi-Fi connection. To combat this, I researched viable solutions to the problem which resulted in me running an ethernet cable the length of my house. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf with my friends and basketball and crickets in teams.

      I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and I come from a Vietnamese heritage, with my parents immigrating here in the 90’s. I live in a west Melbourne suburb called “Brooklyn” which is just under a 20-minute drive to the CBD. I am currently 21 years old and undertaking the final year of my bachelor’s degree in Business Management at RMIT university with a major in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (Applied). As a passion and side hustle I like to detail, fix, restore and sell car parts. My interest in IT sparked when I began to watch Linus Tech Tips back in 2013 leading me to build my first PC in year 8. In terms of IT experience, I have learnt skills in database analytics and modelling with Microsoft Access and Excel during my studies in Business Information Systems. I have also learned how to deploy a private blockchain network, mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and crypto tokens in my Blockchain for Business class.

I am an Australian born university student that has lived in Victoria my whole life that is currently in their last year of studying a bachelor's degree in Business Information Systems at the royal institute of technology. I obtained an interest in the I.T field early during high school where I chose some I.T based elective subjects such as web programming and software development. The teachers I had for these subjects opened my eyes to the vastly growing dependency we all have on I.T, because of this I investigated how I.T could be used to better businesses and there is where I found information systems. Throughout my studies I have acquired SQL/Database skills, forecasting and modelling skills used with large databases, Python coding as well as some HTML, CSS and JavaScript used for web development.

          I was born and raised in Australia with a Cambodian background with my parents immigrating to Australia in the late 80’s. In my spare time I like to hang out with my family doing activities such as fishing, camping and road trips. Whilst not with my family I like to go on drives, detail my car, play snooker, golf and occasionally club. My interest in IT started when my dad got me a secondhand MacBook Pro which ran into a lot of issues, so I started taking it apart, fixing it up and doing some trouble shooting learning from YouTube videos. What really sparked my interest was when my brother was teaching me how to code with python. Further down the track I decided to join RMIT to do a Bachelor of Information Technology and with that my experiences are Python, HTML, CSS, and a bit of SQL

          I am an Australian born university student with a North Macedonian background. I'm currently 23 years old and in my final ‘year’ (only have 1-unit next semester) in a Bachelor of Business (marketing) after switching from a major in economics and finance. My passion for IT naturally developed over my lifetime, as the reliance of technology is becoming increasingly more essential as years pass. Due to being born in the late 90’s, I grew up during a period in which technology was being developed rapidly, going from a teacher pulling in a TV into class to a giant interactable whiteboard a few years later to everything being accessible on a laptop soon after. Growing up during this period naturally made me curious in understanding how these technologies work and operate. In relation to current IT experience, my degree has taught me relevant skills in software such as Microsoft excel as many different analytical tools whether in relation to business/consumer data or software used for stock evaluations.

          My name is Austin, I was born and raised in the Western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. I am half Australian and half Dutch with some family still living in the Netherlands however I unfortunately don’t speak any Dutch. I graduated High School from Foots cray City College in 2021 which means I had the pleasure of doing year 11 and 12 in lockdown. I have been interested with technology since I was a child. I’ve always been a big gamer enjoying games from my childhood such as Halo and Rachet and Clank. This eventually turned into a passion to become a game developer however my interest nowadays is more related to cyber security and AI. My mum has also been an inspiration when it comes to my passion with technology as she works in IT for Microsoft and is always talking about how much she enjoys it. I also would love to travel the world and I believe that a career in IT would allow me to be able to work in many different countries around the world.

          The table above shows the results of different personality tests taken by the members of our group and their ideal jobs. From the personality tests, we can see a diverse range of individuals who may impact how we operate as a group. For example, we only have 2 extroverts in the group, these members will be the driving force of most of the discussions held in meetings. Our group is also heavily towards logical thinkers, even though these tests are not 100% accurate we must take them into account to ensure our weaknesses are covered and strengths are utilised within the group environment. To see how we operated in the group environment please refer to the <A HREF="GroupReflection.html"> Group Reflection </A> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          By looking at everyone's ideal jobs it is clear that whilst they are mostly revolved around the field of IT there is a vast difference in the specific skills required for each of these jobs. Gurpreet and Austin have similarities in their respective fields of cyber security analysts and network engineering, with cyber security being more of an expert field within networks and Internet services. James and Jason Tek all want to pursue careers where software skills are the most required when compared to the rest of the group, with their dream jobs requiring skills in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript and other coding languages and software tools. Tommy and Jason Dang both have ideal jobs which can be viewed as more business-oriented and require some but not a vast knowledge in the IT field. Unlike like James they will be required to know how to use different tech tools but not an understanding of the operations behind them. For a more detailed overview of the various positions chosen please refer to the <a HREF="IndustryData.html"> Industry Data </a> page.
